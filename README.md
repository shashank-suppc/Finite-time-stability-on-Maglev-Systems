# Finite-time-stability-on-Maglev-Systems
This project presents a finite-time sliding mode control approach for stabilizing a nonlinear magnetic levitation system. Finite-time reaching laws are implemented and compared through MATLAB simulations to evaluate convergence speed, stability, and control effort. The results show faster and more robust state convergence .
